Understanding and implementing the Huffman Coding in C++.

Divided in 3 part :
    
    Part1 : Implementing Tree and nodes structure for the project.
    Part2 : Implementing Huffman Encoding.
    Part3 : Implementing Huffman Decoding.
    
This project will hopefully use a graphical display.


The project is structured as shown below :

    Build/      *Makefile and builder for executable*
    Headers/    *every .hh files*
    Src/        *every non main .cpp files*
